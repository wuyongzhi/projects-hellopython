@________, here's some feedback on your Project's sample code and instructions:

I've assigned your next tasks to you in Asana. Next steps:
- Implement this sample code and instructions feedback.
- Complete the tests and hints for all project tasks.
- Run the solution code and the test cells for all tasks locally. Ensure all tests pass.

As always, check your tasks off when done. Asana automatically notifies me of my next task when you finish yours.

Back to you! :)
