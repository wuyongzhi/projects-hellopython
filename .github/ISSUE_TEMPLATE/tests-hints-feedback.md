@________, here's some feedback on your Project's tests and hints:

## What I've done for you:
- Open and read each commit in the `develop` branch's commit history. I provided comments there on what I did and why.

## General

## Task 1

## Task 2

## Task 3

## Task 8

I've assigned your next tasks to you in Asana. Next steps:
- Implement this tests and hints feedback.
- Complete the Project without the aid of solution code, just like a student would. Take notes along the way where you can improve the Project.
- Make content adjustments based on your notes.

As always, check your tasks off when done. Asana automatically notifies me of my next task when you finish yours.

Back to you! :)
