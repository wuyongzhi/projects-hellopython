Hi @__________! Welcome to your private GitHub repository for your DataCamp Project tentatively titled "______________."

## Repo structure

The relevant files/folders in the Project repo are:

- `project.ipynb`: The file that will hold the final Project. The format of this notebook is described [here](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/projects/datacamp-projects-jupyter-notebook).
- `project.yml`: The metadata for your Project, for example, the Project title, Project description, etc.
- `img/`: The folder where images go.
- `datasets/`: The folder where datasets go.
- `README.md`: This contains links to the Project dashboard, your Asana to-do list, and your forked application repo. The Project dashboard is where you can preview the Project on datacamp.com ([screenshare](https://www.useloom.com/share/8a3321cb176f4a75aa7ff07cb87f43cd)) and also has content guideline warnings (line limits, character counts, etc.) that will appear after you push your content to GitHub. Your Asana to-do list contains everything you need to do to launch this Project.
- `requirements.sh`: The file where you install the packages you need for your analysis. If this file isn't completed, you will run into errors when you run the code in your Project on datacamp.com. These errors will also be reported in your Project dashboard.

## Workflow: you create, we give feedback
You will notice a `develop` branch exists -- this is where you will be developing the Project until it is ready for release. Please do not make changes to the `master` branch.

The workflow is as follows:
1. For the tasks assigned to you in Asana, you create content locally on your computer in this repository's `develop` branch.
2. You push all commits up to GitHub when done.
3. You mark off the tasks you just completed in your Asana to-do list.
4. Asana immediately automatically notifies your DataCamp contact that your Project is ready for review.
5. _You do not push any more changes to the `develop` branch until your DataCamp contact has provided feedback._
6. Your DataCamp contact provides feedback and assigns you your next tasks in Asana.
7. You pull in the changes (if made) and begin working on your next tasks.

## What I have done so far

I have set up various parts of this repo:
- Updated `README.md` with links to your Project dashboard and your Asana to-do list.
- Updated `project.yml` with a title.
- Created a GitHub Issue titled "Audition feedback" and provided feedback on your audition there.
- Created a GitHub Issue titled "DataCamp communication strategy".

## Your next steps

After you accept your email invite to your Asana to-do list, your next steps will be outlined there. Remember that you can access your to-do list via the `README.md` file in this repository.

## More info

Also, I've added you to our Enterprise group for instructors, which means you will have Premium DataCamp access as long as you have at least one Project or Course live or in development on DataCamp. You should receive an email with an invite.

Though we aim to provide feedback within three business days of instructors completing their tasks, delays sometimes occur as the DataCamp Projects team is still small. Thank you for your patience in advance.

If you're comfortable, please try to keep track of the time you invest in creating this Project. I've found [Toggl](http://toggl.com) (a free time-tracking tool) useful. Benefits: if we have more concrete data on how long it takes to create a Project, we can make tweaks to the creation process to make it more efficient as well as compensate our instructors more fairly.

Have fun and let me know if you have any questions! :)
