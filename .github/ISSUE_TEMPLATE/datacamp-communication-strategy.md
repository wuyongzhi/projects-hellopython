We want you to build high quality content for DataCamp and we know you'll have questions. The following outlines the steps you should take when you have a question to get them answered quickly and by the right people.

## 1. Have you visited the documentation?

- No? Look for your answer [here](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/). The "Getting Started" and "Projects" collections are the most relevant to you as a Project instructor. Other collections may also contain useful support articles, but keep in mind that the majority of articles are targeted towards course instructors.

- Yes, but I didn't find my answer. --> Move onto step 2

## 2. Ask your DataCamp contact in a GitHub issue

GitHub is the quickest way and clearest way to get a content-related question answered. Furthermore, your GitHub repository will exist as long as your DataCamp content, so if you need to refer to an old issue; it will always be there. **For all matters related to this specific Project, please refrain from communicating via email or Asana comment.**

When writing a new issue, make sure to tag your DataCamp point-of-contact with an @mention. Also, it's imperative that DataCamp can contact **you**. Make sure to watch your repo. If you do not visit GitHub regularly, set up e-mail notifications to ensure you do not miss any issues we send you. Successful instructors are communicative instructors, so please keep in touch with us to ensure smooth and fruitful content creation.
