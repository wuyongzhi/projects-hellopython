Congrats, @_______! Your project is officially ready for soft launch. It is live here: _________

Soft launch means we've marked it live but haven't broadcast it out yet via social or email. Student feedback and ratings will come in, which you will decide to act upon if necessary. I will update you with ratings and feedback here roughly one week from now. The corresponding "Review and implement feedback" Asana tasks are assigned to you.

Note that the criteria for hard launch is an average rating of 4.3 with >= 25 ratings. You will be paid your prepayment upon hard launch. Before then, you are welcome to share the project amongst your network with a note that the project is in soft launch and that feedback is welcome.

Can you provide an estimate on how long it took to create your project in hours? Please include everything from first contact with DataCamp, which includes the application process.

Congrats, once again! ðŸŽ‰
