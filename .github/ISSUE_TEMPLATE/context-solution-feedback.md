@________, here's some feedback on your Project's context and solution code:

## What I've done for you:
- Open and read each commit in the `develop` branch's commit history. I provided comments there on what I did and why.

I've assigned your next tasks to you in Asana. Next steps:
- Implement this context and solution code feedback.
- Get started on the sample code and instructions.

As always, check your tasks off when done. Asana automatically notifies me of my next task when you finish yours.

Back to you! :)
