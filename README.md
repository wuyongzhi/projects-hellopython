The red tasks are for instructors and the blue tasks are for your DataCamp contact. Your DataCamp contact will assign due dates throughout the creation process for your project. All you need to do is report your progress on each task by clicking the checkbox on its left-hand side when complete. Asana training shouldn't be necessary, but here is an Asana [quick start guide](https://asana.com/guide/get-started/begin/quick-start) guide just in case.

# Your audition and tests

Your forked application repo, which contains your audition notebook (`audition.ipynb`) and your tests notebook (`create_tests.ipynb`):

# Things to install and configure

There are some packages you need to be able to create DataCamp projects locally. Run the following commands in a terminal to install them.

*You might need to change pip into pip3 depending on how you installed python.*

```
pip install nose
pip install git+https://github.com/datacamp/ipython_nose
pip install jupytext --upgrade
```

After that, open `project.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook, then click "File" -> "Jupytext" -> "Pair Notebook with Markdown".
